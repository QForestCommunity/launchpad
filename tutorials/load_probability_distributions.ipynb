    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a probability distribution $p$, we want to create a quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$ such that\n",
    "$$|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{i} \\sqrt{p_i} |i\\rangle$$\n",
    "where $|i\\rangle$ represents one of an orthonormal set of states.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we don't known when (for what kinds of distributions) we can do this, we do know that if you can efficiently integrate over a distribution classically, then we can efficiently construct a quantum state associated with a discretized version of that distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem kind of trivial - we can integrate over the distribution classicaly, so why not just create the mixed state shown here?\n",
    "$$\\sum_i p_i |i\\rangle \\langle i |$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If all we needed to do was sample from the distribution, we could use this state - but then if we were efficiently integrating the distribution classicaly, say using Monte Carlo methods, we might as well sample from the classical distribution as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we avoid generating the distribution as a mixed quantum state is that we often need to perfom further, uniquely quantum, processing on it after creation - in this case, we cannot use the mixed state apporach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encoding the distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to create a $N$ region discretization, we would need $n = log N$ qubits to represent the distribution. Let's look at a super simple case to start off: $N = 2$, so $n = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have probabilities $p_{0}^{(1)}$ and $p_1^{(1)}$, of a random variable following the distribution lying in region $0$ and region $1$, respectively, with $p^{(i)}_{j}$ representing the probability of measuring a random variable in region $j$ if it follows the discretized distribution over $i$ qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we only use one qubit, all we need to do is integrate over region $0$ to find the probability of a variable lying within it. Let's take a quick look at the Bloch sphere:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bloch Sphere](./img/load_probability_distributions/bloch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a qubit is rotated about the y-axis by angle $\\theta$, then the probability of measuring it as zero is given by $\\cos (\\frac{\\theta}{2})^2$ - so we can figure out how much to rotate a qubit by if we're using it to encode a distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\theta = 2 * \\cos^{-1} \\left ( \\sqrt{p_{0}^{(1)}}\\right )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_{0}^{(1)} = \\int_{x^{(1)}_{0}}^{x_{1}^{(1)}}p(x) dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $p$ is the distribution's density function, and $x^{(1)}_{0}$ and $x_{1}^{(1)}$ are the first and second region boundaries when 1 qubit is used. This leaves us with\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\psi \\rangle = \\sqrt{p_{0}^{(1)}} |0\\rangle + \\sqrt{p_{1}^{(1)}} |1\\rangle$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "Awesome!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to do it for distributions with two regions, let's see if we can expand it to include more regions - i.e., can we convert a quantum state encoding a $N$ region discretization into one encoding a discretization with $2N$ regions?\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, let's avoid all the complicated integration stuff we'll need to do later by defining a function $f(i, n)$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(i, n) = \\frac{\\int_{x_{k}^{(n + 1)}}^{x_{k + 1}^{(n + 1)}} p(x) dx}{\\int^{x_{i + 1}^{(n)}}_{x_{i}^{(n)}} p(x) dx}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $k = 2 * \\left ( \\frac{i}{2} - \\frac{i \\% 2}{2} \\right )$. The equation above probably looks a little hopeless, but all it does it computes the conditional probability of a value lying in the left subregion of region $i$ (when we have $N$ regions), given that it lies in region $i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need this?\n",
    "\n",
    "We're assuming that dividing the distribution into $N$ regions is just an intermediary step in the process of dividing it into the desired $2^{m}$ regions - so $x_{k}^{(n + 1)}$ refers to the same boundary that $x_{i}^{(n)}$ does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've defined $f(i, n)$, all we need to do to figure out how much to rotate the $(n + 1)^{th}$ qubit is compute\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta_{i}^{(n + 1)} = 2 * \\cos^{-1} \\left ( \\sqrt{f(i, n)}\\right )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now all we need to do is rotate the $(n + 1)^{th}$ qubit by $\\theta_{i}^{(n + 1)}$ conditioned on the state $|i\\rangle$ represented using $n$ qubits:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{p_{i}^{(n)}}|i\\rangle \\rightarrow \\sqrt{p^{(n + 1)}_{k}}|k\\rangle + \\sqrt{p^{(n + 1)}_{k + 1}}|k+1\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we showed that constructing a state for $n = 1$ was possible, and given a $2^n$ region discretization, we could convert into a distribution with $2^{(n + 1)}$ regions, we just inductively proved that we can construct a superposition state corresponding to a $2^n, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ region discretized distribution - pretty cool!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've gotten the concepts down, let's move on to building our own quantum distribution encoder.\n",
