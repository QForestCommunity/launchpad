# Welcome to QForest!

This repository contains resources to get you started in the field of quantum computing.
  
### Getting started :rocket:
- _Are you completely new to quantum computing?_  
If you are, then that's amazing! You're about to be inrtoduced to a whole new world of possibilities. For an introduction to quantum computing, you can check out our article on it and take a [Dive Into The Quantum Realm](https://medium.com/qvillage/diving-into-the-quantum-realm-124c26f293cb) with us!  
  
- _For an in-depth introduction to the math under the hood, you can check these out:_
  - [qkitchen](https://gitlab.com/qkitchen/basics-of-quantum-computing/-/tree/master/math): Explanations along with a few fun exercises.  
  - [Week 0: A crash course on quantum information](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:CaltechDelftX+QuCryptox+3T2018/course/): A few really good videos on the basics of quantum information and the math behind it. 
  - [IBM Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-prerequisites/linear_algebra.html): Linear ALgebra pre-requisites for Quantum Computing.  
  - [Quantum Algorithms via Linear Algebra](http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608149911380.pdf): Feel refer to topics in chapters 1-6 for queries related to the math behind Quantum Computing.  
  
- _Next steps:_
  - [IBM Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/representing-qubit-states.html): Representing qubits
  - [Single qubit gates](https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/qc-programming-with-quantum-gates-8996b667d256): Operations on a single qubit.
  - [An introduction to 2-qubit gates](https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/qc-programming-with-quantum-gates-2-qubit-operator-871528d136db): Operations on two qubits. 
  - [Multiple qubits and quantum logic gates](https://medium.com/qvillage/multiple-qubits-and-quantum-logic-gates-edc3b0190fd9): An introduction to multi-qubit operations and quantum logic gates. 
   
 ### Feeling good about your basics? Translate theory into code! :fire:  
 - [qkitchen](https://gitlab.com/qkitchen/basics-of-quantum-computing/-/tree/master/python): A few basics of Python to help you get started.
 - [Coding with Qiskit](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-Vvp2xg9-POLJhQwtVktlYGbY): _Highly recommended_ video series by IBM Qiskit on getting started with coding in Qiskit. 
 - [qkitchen](https://gitlab.com/qkitchen/basics-of-quantum-computing/-/tree/master/bronze): Fun programming exercises on quantum computing along with solutions. 
 - [IBM Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html): An exhaustive resource on theory and code.  
   
 ### A few extra resources that absolutely made us fall in love with quantum:
 - [An Introduction to Quantum Information Science, MIT](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.370.1x+1T2018/course/): A few exceptionally fascinating videos on the theoretical aspects of Quantum Computing.  
 - [The Introduction to Quantum Computing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantum-computing-algorithms/home/welcome): A thorough exploration of the concepts of quantum computing and the various facets of quantum algorithms.
